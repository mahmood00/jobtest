Login Page:
when you login, the application will redirect you to the search page.

Search Page:
you can create search by city of tour.
When you click on search button the angular will send
request to the system A , with city that you intered on the text input.
then system A will get the data from it's database `test_a` as array.
and it will build XML Request to send it to system B , contains city and Auth data.
then validate it using XSD file "tour_request.xsd" to check if it has correct XML format and correct data.
then it will send the XML to System B with header "application/xml"  by CURL.

In system B will receive the XML and convert it to object to check auth data, and get the city, 
after query on the tour from database `test_b` it will build the tours data as XML and return it using output
class in CI as XML response with "text/xml" as content type.

then system A will receive the XML responce and validate it using XSD file "tours.xsd",
after that will convert these data to array , and merge it with data that we got it from system A .

then system A will return the data as json output to help angular to parse and convert it to array of objects.

after that angular will display them on the result space sorted and with limit 10 rows,
and when you scroll to the bottom of the page it will load another 10 rows.


How To Run the Application:
	1- import the database files : 'test_a' and 'test_b'
	2- CI mysql database config : username is 'root' ,and the password is empty.
	3- and this is login page : http://SERVER/a/index.php#/
	4- if you import my DB files , you can login by username : 'mahood' and password: 'mahmood'.
	5- and both of DB files contain three cities: 'dubai', 'tulkarem', 'nablus'.
	6- when you search by 'dubai' city there are more than 10 result ,
		so the page will just display 10 rows, and when you scroll at the bottom the page will load another rows.
		
		
Note:
	you can create new user by this url 
	http://SERVER/a/index.php/user/createUser/mahmood
	pass your username as parameter for createUser action and the password will be the same.
